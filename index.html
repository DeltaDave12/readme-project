        <h3>Origin</h3>
        <p>Carbonara is one of Rome's four classic pastas (cacio e pepe, amatriciana, and gricia are the others). There are a slew of theories about its possible origins, including:

            It was invented by Italian carbonari (charcoal workers) who prepared the dish on their shovels over a fire.
            The name refers to the ground black pepper in the dish that resembles flecks of coal (carbone means charcoal in Italian).
            It was a marrying of traditions between American soldiers in Italy during World War II and their bacon and egg rations with the local pasta dishes.</p>

        <h3>How to make</h3>
        <p>
            Add bacon and water to a skillet and bring to a simmer
        </p>
        <p> Continue simmering until water is evaporated, then continue to cook the bacon until crispy.
        </p>
        <p> Remove bacon from pan and reserve the drippings.
                Saute garlic in that same skillet until golden brown, then add to a bowl with 1 tablespoon bacon fat, eggs, egg yolk, Parmesan and pepper. Mix well
        </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti or linguine pasta     until al dente. Once cooked, drain pasta and reserve 1 cup of the cooking water.
        Slowly pour the hot cooking water into the egg mixture. Then pour over the hot pasta and toss to coat. Add crumbled bacon.
        </p>
        <p>
        Let pasta rest for a few minutes, tossing frequently until the carbonara sauce thickens. Serve immediately with a sprinkle of fresh parsley.
