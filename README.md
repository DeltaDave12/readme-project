# Put responsive on a website !
Responsive is a adjectiv of the term website wich informatically means that the website adapts its display to different screen widths.
## Introduction 
Hello everyone, thank you for checking my guide to put responsive into an html website ! When a website is responsive, it means that it creates dynamic changes to the appearance of the page, depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it. To visualize responsive, let's say that if i code that a kitten image into my page, it should appear only when the screen width is bigger than 500px : it means that most mobile users visiting my page won't see the kitten image but that somebody on a computer can. We can seet that responsive is very important for design measures and user experience, responsive is needd so that a website has a clear display on any device possible : it is frustrating if someone needs a computer to use properly your food-delivery If responsive is still not celar, making this project will make you understand or you can go through the "documentation" section to see for yourself. As i said, responsive is very important for me because i think that anyone visiting my website should not be using its brain or have dislay issues when visiting it, i think it should be the same for your website(s) too :) .
## Utilities
You need these things to make a responsive website, you can change some softwares depending on your personal preferences : 
- A software in which you can code HTML and CSS (version 5 and 3 at least), use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you don't have any.
- A recent and updated version of an internet browser like google chrome or firefox
- Some space on your hard-drive
- A mouse (or mousepad), keyboard, hands and a brain :)
# The PASTA project
## Setting up our project
To start off, create a folder in which you will work on your project. In this folder, you will create another folder for CSS, fonts, image (in general we name it assets), inside create your CSS file (name it stlyles to avoid confusion), then make an html file which is your website (again, named generally index.html). You should have something like below :

Now we are ready to start coding our website !
## Making the PASTA website
Do not forget to tell the computer that your are in HTML and to link the HTML and CSS files ! Here is what I wrote for my website, try to keep the same structure and to make the same classes to understand the responsive part.

Basic HTML structure :
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Make a good pasta dish</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

HTML Code :

CSS Code :

What the user sees on the Browser :
